# Hi everyone! I'm Nicolas KatzðŸ˜€

I worked as a frontend developer for 1+ year, with ReactJS as my primary technology. Currently, I am transitioning my career by providing digital solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, using Webflow as my main tool. Even though I now focus on the world of no-code, I still have a strong coding background. Here are the technologies I have worked with to date:

- HTML/CSS
- SASS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- ReactJS (HOOKS, Context API, Styled-Components)
- VueJS
- NodeJS (ExpressJS)
- Firebase
- MongoDB
- Python (Flask)

Feel free to contact me.
