# Hi everyone! I'm Nicolas KatzðŸ˜€

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer but currently I'm improving my Front-end skills, venturing into ReactJS as the main technologie.

Why I turned a ReactJS lover ?

I choose to develop my Front-end with ReactJS given its ease of learning and its thousands of tools offered by this library. Design a study plan to try to make the most of it and squeeze its full potential. 

Nowadays, I'm doing diffents kinds of projects to improve some ReactJS skills like Hooks, ReduxJS, Styling (with TailwindCSS and Styled-Components), TSX (ReactJS with TypeScript), Testing (with React-Testing-Library), Firebase and MERN. But also soon I will add to my stack new technologies like NextJS and Gatsby.
